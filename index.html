                                        plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a novel, but typically to a
                                        lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel or
                                        novella/short novel, authors generally draw from a common pool of literary
                                        techniques.

                                        Determining what exactly separates a short story from longer fictional formats
                                        is problematic. A classic definition of a short story is that one should be able
                                        to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in Edgar Allan Poe's essay
                                        "The Philosophy of Composition" (1846).[1] According to William Faulkner, a
                                        short story is character driven and a writer's job is to "...trot along behind
                                        him with a paper and pencil trying to keep up long enough to put down what he
                                        says and does.”[2]

                                        Some authors have argued that a short story must have a strict form. Somerset
                                        Maugham thought that the short story "must have a definite design, which
                                        includes a point of departure, a climax and a point of test; in other words, it
                                        must have a plot". This view is however opposed by Anton Chekov who thought that
                                        a story should have neither a beginning nor an end. It should just be a "slice
                                        of life", presented suggestively.[3]

                        Short story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of
                        the form. They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation.[3]

                        Short stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognized in modern
                        society for hundreds of years.
